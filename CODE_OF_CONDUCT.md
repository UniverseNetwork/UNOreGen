## Our Pledge  
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards  
- Use welcoming and inclusive language  
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism  
- Focus on what is best for the community  
- Show empathy towards other community members  

## Our Responsibilities  
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.    
Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.    

## Enforcement  
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team [on Discord](https://discord.gg/3xgsPh8). The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.  
Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
